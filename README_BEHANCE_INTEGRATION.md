## 🔧 How to Add Your Portfolio Data

### Step 1: Update Project Data
Edit `src/hooks/useBehanceAPI.tsx` and replace the mock projects with your actual work:

```typescript
const mockProjects: BehanceProject[] = [
  {
    id: 'your-project-id',
    name: 'Your Project Name',
    description: 'Your project description',
    covers: {
      "404": 'thumbnail-url',
      "808": 'medium-url', 
      original: 'full-size-url'
    },
    fields: ['Your', 'Categories'],
    tags: ['your', 'tags'],
    stats: {
      views: 12000,
      appreciations: 500,
      comments: 50
    },
    // ... other fields
  }
];
```

### Step 2: Upload Your Images
Choose one of these hosting options:
- **Cloudinary** (Recommended): Free tier with transformations
- **Imgur**: Simple and reliable
- **AWS S3**: Professional solution
- **GitHub**: For public repositories

### Step 3: Update User Profile
Customize your profile information in the `useBehanceUser` hook.

## 🎯 Current Status: API Information

**Important:** The original Behance API has been deprecated by Adobe. However, our system is designed to:

1. **Work immediately** with manual data entry
2. **Scale easily** when alternative APIs become available
3. **Maintain professional standards** with industry-standard data structures

## 🔄 Future Migration Options

### Alternative APIs to Consider:
1. **Instagram Basic Display API** - For social portfolio
2. **Dribbble API** - For design-focused work
3. **Custom Supabase API** - Full control with real-time updates

### Easy Migration Path:
Our hooks maintain consistent interfaces, so switching to real APIs only requires updating the `queryFn` functions.

## 🎨 Design System Integration

### Color Scheme:
- Primary: Blue gradients (#3B82F6 to #8B5CF6)
- Secondary: Purple accents
- Backgrounds: Dark themes with transparency
- Text: High contrast for readability

### Animation Classes:
- `animate-slide-up-fade`: Content entrance
- `animate-scale-in-bounce`: Emphasis effects
- `animate-fade-in`: Smooth transitions
- `portfolio-card`: Enhanced card animations

## 📱 Responsive Features

- **Mobile-first design**: Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Touch-friendly**: Large tap targets and smooth scrolling
- **Performance**: Optimized images and lazy loading
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **React Query Caching**: Intelligent data caching
2. **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with WebP support
3. **Lazy Loading**: Components load as needed
4. **Animation Performance**: GPU-accelerated transforms

## 📖 Documentation

Comprehensive setup guide available in `docs/BEHANCE_API_SETUP.md` covering:
